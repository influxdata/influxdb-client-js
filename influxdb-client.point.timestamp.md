## Point.timestamp() method

Sets point timestamp. Timestamp can be specified as a Date (preferred), number, string or an undefined value. An undefined value instructs to assign a local timestamp using the client's clock. An empty string can be used to let the server assign the timestamp. A number value represents time as a count of time units since epoch, the exact time unit then depends on the [precision](./influxdb-client.influxdb.getwriteapi.md) of the API that writes the point.

Beware that the current time in nanoseconds can't precisely fit into a JS number, which can hold at most 2^53 integer number. Nanosecond precision numbers are thus supplied as a (base-10) string. An application can also use ES2020 BigInt to represent nanoseconds, BigInt's `toString()` returns the required high-precision string.

Note that InfluxDB requires the timestamp to fit into int64 data type.
