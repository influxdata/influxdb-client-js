## QueryApi interface

Query InfluxDB. Provides methods that notify about result lines of the executed query. See [https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/api/\#operation/PostQuery](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/api/#operation/PostQuery)

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
interface QueryApi 
```

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [collectLines(query)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.collectlines.md) | CollectLines executes the query and collects all result lines in the returned Promise. This method is suitable to collect simple results. Use with caution, a possibly huge stream of lines is copied to memory. |
|  [collectRows(query, rowMapper)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.collectrows.md) | CollectRows executes the query and collects all the results in the returned Promise. This method is suitable to collect simple results. Use with caution, a possibly huge stream of results is copied to memory. |
|  [iterateLines(query)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.iteratelines.md) | IterateLines executes the supplied query and returns results in an async iterable of annotated CSV lines. Async iterables are best consumed by <code>for-await</code> loop. |
|  [iterateRows(query)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.iteraterows.md) | IterateRows executes the supplied query and returns results in an async iterable of row data and table metadata pairs. Async iterables are best consumed by <code>for-await</code> loop. |
|  [lines(query)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.lines.md) | Creates a cold observable of the lines returned by the given query. |
|  [queryLines(query, consumer)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.querylines.md) | Executes the query and receives result lines (including empty and annotation lines) through the supplied consumer. See [annotated-csv](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/reference/syntax/annotated-csv/)<!-- -->. |
|  [queryRaw(query)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.queryraw.md) | QueryRaw executes a query and returns the full response as a string. Use with caution, a possibly huge stream is copied to memory. |
|  [queryRows(query, consumer)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.queryrows.md) | Executes the query and receives table metadata and rows through the supplied consumer. |
|  [response(query)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.response.md) | Response returns an AnnotatedCSVResponse instance that executes the query when asked for data. |
|  [rows(query)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.rows.md) | Creates a cold observable of the rows returned by the given query. |
|  [with(options)](./influxdb-client.queryapi.with.md) | Returns a new query API with extra options applied. |
